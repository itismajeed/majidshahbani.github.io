                        I always loved the technology since childhood, so when I first met my first computer I thought
                        this is what I want to do for a living. I learned how to work with microsft office by myself,
                        then I went to
                        college and solved my first programming problem in my first class in front of all my college
                        friends ,
                        that day was a break for me , so I decided to choose programming as my career.
                        I love the way programming helps us to do things faster and better.
                        I learned how to create websites by learning HTML,CSS and JS and then learned PHP after that I
                        hired by company named
                        Pazh Networks who works in Networking field and it's a giant in iran's netwrorking, there I
                        learned Yii (PHP mvc framework)
                        and did some real stuff with that for governmental companies. I learned a bit android with basic
                        knowledge of java I had before
                        for networklab.ir which canceled by company's policies. Now I am a soldier till september 2021,
                        I try to learn some mobile
                        programming stuff with flutter and I look forward to be a good Mobile Developer.
